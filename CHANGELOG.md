## [0.0.84] - 2025-10-07

**Patch Release**

- üîß **Auto-Configuration for AI CLIs**: Automatically writes `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) and `.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor) so MCP servers are instantly available

## [0.0.83] - 2025-10-07

**Patch Release**

- OpenCode MCP Support: Added auto-configuration for .opencode.json alongside Claude Code and Cursor
- OpenCode uses different format: type local with command arrays, proxied via @modelcontextprotocol/inspector for HTTP MCP servers

## [0.0.82] - 2025-10-07

**Patch Release**

- Auto-Configuration for AI CLIs: Automatically writes .mcp.json (Claude Code) and .cursor/mcp.json (Cursor) so MCP servers are instantly available
- New find_component_source MCP tool: Maps DOM elements to React component source code by extracting the component function and providing targeted grep patterns to locate source files
- Removed get_react_component_info tool: React 19 removed __reactFiber$ properties from DOM nodes, making the old approach obsolete

## [0.0.81] - 2025-10-07

**Feature Release**

- New analyze_visual_diff MCP tool provides detailed descriptions of before/after screenshot differences for CLS debugging
- Fixed CLS frame detection to show exact frames where layout shifts occur (N-2 and N-1), not just nearby frames
- fix_my_jank now includes direct links to screenshots showing the visual change that caused each layout shift
- Consolidated log tags (CONSOLE.ERROR ‚Üí ERROR) and removed padding to maximize horizontal space for narrow terminals
- SERVER logs now extract and display HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) as secondary tags with smart alignment
- Changed 'video' to 'frame sequence' throughout to match actual functionality

## [0.0.80] - 2025-10-06

## [0.0.79] - 2025-10-06

**Feature Release**

- Passive screencast capture automatically records page loads and navigations without slowing down your dev server
- CLS detection video viewer shows frame-by-frame video of layout shifts with red bounding boxes highlighting exactly which elements shifted
- Real PerformanceObserver integration uses browser APIs to detect actual layout shifts (not just pixel-diff guessing), with querySelector to find precise element positions
- New fix_my_jank MCP tool automatically analyzes performance issues and CLS problems, flagging critical UI shifts in NAV/HEADER elements
- Better header and status line rendering for narrow terminal windows

## [0.0.78] - 2025-10-03

**Patch Release**

- Auto-configuration for AI CLIs: automatically writes .mcp.json (Claude Code) and .cursor/mcp.json (Cursor) so MCP servers are instantly available
