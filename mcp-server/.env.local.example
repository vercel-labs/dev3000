# Environment variables for local development

# IMPORTANT: To make your local dev server just a "view" to cloud workflows:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Uncomment NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKFLOW_API_URL and set it to your production URL
# 3. This makes the frontend call production APIs instead of local ones

# Force workflows to run in production (cloud) instead of locally
# When set, the frontend will call this URL instead of relative paths
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKFLOW_API_URL=https://d3k-mcp.vercel.sh
