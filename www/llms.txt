# dev3000

> AI-powered development tools with comprehensive browser monitoring and skill-based agent guidance

## Overview

dev3000 is a TypeScript package that gives AI assistants deep visibility into local development workflows. It captures unified logs from servers, browsers, and user interactions, making debugging and development assistance dramatically more effective.

## Key Features

- **Unified Logging**: Consolidates server output, browser console logs, network requests, user interactions, and automatic screenshots into a single timeline
- **Skill Integration**: Ships a built-in d3k skill and supports optional skill packs installed via the skills CLI
- **Dual Monitoring**: Choose between Playwright automation or headless Chrome monitoring
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live log parsing and search capabilities with timestamp-based debugging workflows
- **Screenshot Automation**: Captures screenshots on errors, navigation, and interactions for visual context

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CLI Tool (`src/cli.ts`)**
   - Main entry point with Commander.js interface
   - Commands: `start` (dev environment), `setup` (project setup)
   - Default command is `start` if no subcommand provided

2. **Development Environment (`src/dev-environment.ts`)**
   - Orchestrates dev server + browser monitoring
   - Works with any web framework (Next.js, Vite, React, etc.)
   - Port management (defaults: 3000 for app)
   - Chrome profile management and unified logging

3. **Browser Monitoring (`src/cdp-monitor.ts`)**
   - Chrome DevTools Protocol integration
   - Captures console logs, network requests, page errors, navigation
   - User interaction tracking (clicks, scrolls, typing)
   - Automatic screenshot capture on events

4. **Skills (`src/skills/`)**
   - Built-in d3k skill for debugging workflows
   - Optional skill packs installed via `npx skills`

### Log Format

All logs use unified timestamps with source prefixes:
```
[2025-01-15T12:54:03.033Z] [SERVER] Ready on http://localhost:3000
[2025-01-15T12:54:03.435Z] [BROWSER] [CONSOLE LOG] App initialized
[2025-01-15T12:54:03.500Z] [BROWSER] [NETWORK REQUEST] GET http://localhost:3000/api/data
[2025-01-15T12:54:03.650Z] [BROWSER] [INTERACTION] CLICK at 150,200 on button.submit
[2025-01-15T12:54:03.700Z] [BROWSER] [SCREENSHOT] interaction-click.png
```

## Installation & Usage

### Global Installation
```bash
bun install -g dev3000
```

### Project Setup
```bash
# Initialize in Next.js project
dev3000 setup

# Start monitoring (default mode with Playwright)
dev3000
# or explicitly:
dev3000 start

# Custom configuration
dev3000 --port 5173 --profile-dir ./my-profile
```

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5+
- **Package Manager**: Bun (required)
- **Browser Automation**: Chrome DevTools Protocol, Playwright
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Linting**: Biome

## Integration with AI Assistants

dev3000 is specifically designed to enhance AI-assisted development:

1. **Comprehensive Context**: AI assistants get full visibility into user interactions, server responses, and browser state
2. **Temporal Debugging**: Timestamp-based log analysis lets AI correlate user actions with system responses
3. **Visual Context**: Screenshots provide visual debugging context that pure logs cannot
4. **Safe Automation**: Browser automation tools let AI test fixes and reproduce issues safely
5. **Real-time Analysis**: Live log analysis enables immediate debugging assistance

## Use Cases

- **Debugging Next.js applications** with AI assistance
- **Correlating user interactions** with server/browser events
- **Visual debugging** with automatic screenshots
- **Session replay analysis** for user experience issues
- **Performance monitoring** with network request tracking
- **Error tracking** with full context capture
- **Development workflow optimization** through AI insights

## Target Audience

- Next.js developers using AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Development teams wanting better debugging visibility
- AI-powered development tool integrators
- Anyone building complex web applications needing comprehensive monitoring
